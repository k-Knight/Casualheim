# Casualheim
Makes Valheim more casual in several ways.

## Cancelling attacks
Allows a player to cancel their attack if the attack has not yet dealt damage by:
- blocking
- dodging
- jumping

## Enemy health nerf
Allows a player to set the % of max HP that Ashlands enemies will have.
Settings are individual for every mob.
Generally makes so that the enemies are less spongy.
